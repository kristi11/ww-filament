<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üöÄ Getting Started

Get WittyWorkflow running in minutes‚Äîperfect for prototyping or building your next niche app.

### üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- **PHP 8.1+** with the following extensions:
  - BCMath
  - Ctype
  - Fileinfo
  - JSON
  - Mbstring
  - OpenSSL
  - PDO
  - Tokenizer
  - XML
- **Composer 2.0+**
- **Node.js 16+** and NPM
- **MySQL 5.7+** or PostgreSQL 10+
- **Git**


#### ‚ö° Quickstart

##### Automated Setup (Recommended)

WittyWorkflow provides convenient setup commands to automate the installation process:

1. Clone the repo and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kristi11/ww-filament.git
   cd ww-filament
   ```

2. Run the automated setup command:
   ```bash
   php artisan app:setup
   ```

   This command will:
   - Install NPM and Composer dependencies
   - Create .env file from .env.example
   - Generate application key
   - Run database migrations with seeding
   - Set up Shield with proper permissions
   - Create storage link
   - Build assets

   **Available options:**
   - `--no-key`: Skip the key generation step
   - `--production`: Use npm run build instead of npm run dev (for production environments)

   After setup is complete, start the development server with:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

3. Visit your application in the browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```

##### Shield Setup Only

If you need to set up just the Shield permissions system:

```bash
php artisan app:setup-shield
```

This command will:
- Run fresh migrations with seeding
- Set up Shield with proper permissions
- Generate Shield resources for the admin panel
- Set up the super admin user

##### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run commands individually or need more control over the setup process:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kristi11/ww-filament.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd ww-filament
    ```

3. Install NPM dependencies:
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

4. Install the composer dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```
5. Create a copy of your .env file:
   ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
   ```
6. Generate an app encryption key:
   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

   > **Note:** If using Laravel [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/), there's no need to generate a key since Forge handles key generation when creating the server.

7. Create an empty database for your application. We recommend using [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/), but you can use any database management tool you prefer.

8. In the `.env` file, add database information to allow Laravel to connect to the database. The default database name is `ww_filament`. If you are using a different name, you'll need to edit the `DB_DATABASE` variable in the `.env` file with your database name.

9. Migrate and seed the database:
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
   ```
10. Set up Shield for user roles and permissions:
   ```bash
   php artisan shield:setup --fresh
   php artisan shield:generate --all --panel=admin
   ```

   Then define the super admin of the system:
   ```bash
   php artisan shield:super-admin --user="1"
   ```

   `--user=1` is the `id` of the user that will be the `super admin`. You can change it to whatever user you want to be the `super admin`.

11. Link the storage folder:
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```
12. Run the application:
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```
13. Visit your application in the browser:
    ```
    http://localhost:8000
    ```

14. Compile assets for development:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### üìù Command list

For quick reference, here are the commands to set up WittyWorkflow:

#### Automated Setup (Single Command)

```bash
# Complete setup with one command
php artisan app:setup

# Options:
# --no-key      Skip the key generation step
# --production  Use npm run build instead of npm run dev

# After setup, start the server with:
php artisan serve
```

#### Shield Setup Only

```bash
# Set up Shield permissions system only
php artisan app:setup-shield
```

#### Manual Setup (Individual Commands)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kristi11/ww-filament.git .
npm install
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
php artisan shield:setup --fresh
php artisan shield:generate --all --panel=admin
php artisan shield:super-admin --user="1"
php artisan storage:link
npm run dev
php artisan serve
```

### ‚ùì Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during installation, here are solutions to common problems:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Class not found errors** | Run `composer dump-autoload` |
| **Node.js errors** | Ensure you're using Node.js 16+ with `node -v` |
| **Database connection errors** | Verify credentials in `.env` file |
| **Permission issues** | Check directory permissions, especially for storage and bootstrap/cache |
| **Blank page after installation** | Check PHP error logs and ensure all requirements are met |
| **Missing images/assets** | Run `php artisan storage:link` again |
| **Shield errors** | Run `php artisan optimize:clear` then retry Shield commands |

For more complex issues, check the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) or open an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kristi11/wittyworkflow/issues).

### üìß Email Configuration

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to update your Mail settings to reflect your production server's needs

For local email testing, we recommend [Mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/). To use Mailtrap:

1. Create a Mailtrap account
2. Add your Mailtrap credentials to the `.env` file:

```
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=your_username
MAIL_PASSWORD=your_password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=your_email
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

If you are using [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com/), you can add the credentials to the server environment variables.

<!-- SHOP -->

## üõí Shop

WittyWorkflow includes a fully-featured e-commerce system built with the TALL stack and integrated with Stripe for payment processing. This section will guide you through setting up and using the shop functionality.

### üèóÔ∏è Shop Architecture Overview

The shop system consists of several key components:

- **Products & Variants**: Products can have multiple variants (size, color, etc.)
- **Cart System**: Manages items added to a user's cart
- **Checkout Process**: Integrated with Stripe for secure payments

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up the Shop

#### 1. Stripe Integration

First, add your Stripe credentials to your `.env` file:

```
STRIPE_KEY=your-stripe-key
STRIPE_SECRET=your-stripe-secret
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-stripe-webhook-secret
```

##### Development Environment Setup

For local testing:

1. Install [stripe-cli](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-cli)
2. Run `stripe login` to authenticate with your Stripe account
3. Start the webhook listener:
   ```
   stripe listen --forward-to {your-local-url}/stripe/webhook --format JSON
   ```
4. Copy the webhook signing secret provided by the CLI to your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`

##### Production Environment Setup

For production:

1. Run `php artisan cashier:webhook` on your server to register the webhook with Stripe
2. Go to the [Stripe Webhooks Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks)
3. Click on the newly created webhook
4. Copy the "Signing Secret" to your `.env` file as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
5. Ensure the `checkout.session.completed` event is enabled:
   - Click the "..." button on the webhook
   - Choose "Update details"
   - Under "Events to send", click "Select events..."
   - Add `checkout.session.completed`

#### 2. Database Configuration

The shop system uses several database tables:

- `products`: Stores product information
- `product_variants`: Stores variant information for products
- `carts`: Manages user shopping carts
- `cart_items`: Stores items in carts
- `orders`: Tracks completed orders
- `order_items`: Stores items in orders

These tables are created automatically when you run migrations.

### üõçÔ∏è Using the Shop System

#### Product Management

Products are managed through the Filament admin panel:

1. Navigate to the Products section in the admin panel
2. Create products with basic information (name, description, price, image)
3. Add variants for each product (size, color, etc.)

#### Cart Functionality

The cart system allows users to:

- Add products to their cart
- Update quantities
- Remove items
- View cart totals

The cart is implemented using the `Cart` and `CartItems` models, with the `AddProductVariantToCart` action handling the addition of products.

#### Checkout Process

The checkout process is handled by:

1. `CreateStripeCheckoutSession`: Creates a Stripe checkout session from the cart
2. `HandleCheckoutSessionCompleted`: Processes the completed checkout, creates an order, and clears the cart

#### Order Management

After checkout, orders are:

1. Created in the database with billing and shipping information
2. Associated with the user who made the purchase
3. Viewable in the admin panel for management

### üß™ Testing the Shop

To test purchases in your development environment:

1. Use Stripe's test card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
2. Any future expiration date (e.g., `03/30`)
3. Any 3-digit CVC code (e.g., `123`)
4. Any name and address information

### üöÄ Going Live

To switch to production mode:

1. Complete your business profile in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/account)
2. Switch from test to live API keys in your `.env` file
3. Ensure your webhook is properly configured for the live environment
4. Test the complete purchase flow with a real card (consider using a small amount)

### üîß Customizing the Shop

The shop system is designed to be customizable:

- **Product Variants**: Add custom variants in `app/Enums/` and update the `ProductVariant` model
- **Checkout Flow**: Modify the `CreateStripeCheckoutSession` class to customize checkout options
- **Order Processing**: Extend the `HandleCheckoutSessionCompleted` class to add custom logic after purchase

See the [Adding Variants](#adding-variants) section for detailed instructions on customizing product variants.

<p align="right">(<a href="#about-the-project">back to top</a>)</p>

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### **Disabled features:**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> #####  Switch the `canEdit()` function in `CRUDSettingsResource.php` to `true` ose `false` to enable or disable choosing whether the admin should be able to edit content or not.

### **Side note:**

#### If the `canCreate()`, `canEdit()` or `canDelete()` functions return anything other than a `true` or `false` value is best not to mess with that value because that value is supposed to be that way.

WittyWorkflow uses [filament-breezy](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/jeffgreco-breezy) to
manage user profiles. Change the following value to `shouldRegisterUserMenu: true/false` depending on your app's needs,
to `enable/disable` profile editing on `AdminPanelProvider.php` and `TeamPanelProvider.php` for the `Admin` and `Team member`
roles

```php
->myProfile(
    shouldRegisterUserMenu: false, // Sets the 'account' link in the panel User Menu (default = false)
    shouldRegisterNavigation: false, // Adds a main navigation item for the My Profile page (default = false)
    navigationGroup: 'Settings', // Sets the navigation group for the My Profile page (default = null)

```

### üë• Role configuration

WittyWorkflow used the [Shield](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/bezhansalleh-shield)
package to manage roles as stated above. In order to give permissions to manage appointments go on the `Roles` section of the dashboard, inside the `Settings` sidebar menu group and for both `team_user` and `panel_user` choose `select all` on
the `Appointment` model permissions and to give the `panel_user` view permissions on the gallery choose  `view`
and `view any` under the `Gallery` model permissions. Also give the `panel_user` all permissions on the `Order` model permissions.

### üîë Role explanation

#### In order to use the Team role you need to create the role from the admin panel and the name of the role should be 'team_user' as it doesn't exist by default and then assign that role to a desired user. Multiple roles can be assigned to a user

* `super_admin` = The super admin of the system
* `team_user` = The team members of the system assigned by the Super Admin
* `panel_user` = The panel for the customers

### üîÑ Panel switching

> [!NOTE]
>
> In order to properly switch user panels for different roles the admin of the system must be assigned all the available roles (`super_admin`, `team_user` and `panel_user`) in the user resource. That way the admin will not be prompted with a `403` code when trying to access a panel that he doesn't have access to.

<!-- Adding variants -->

### üîÑ Adding variants

**There are quite a few steps you need to take to add/edit/delete variants, and I'll walk you through all of them:**

* Create migration to `add/edit/delete` database variants.
* Update the `ProductVariant.php` factory if needed. As of now only the `size` and `color` variants are assigned on the initial database seed just to keep things simple.
* Add the`Enum` for the newly created variant in `App/Enums`. To keep things simple, the enum can be named the same name as the database column, but you can name it whatever you want.
* Update the `getForm()` function in `ProductVariant.php` model, add/edit/delete the desired variants.
* Update the `$table` function in `ProductVariantResource.php`, add/edit/delete the desired variants.
* Update the `$table` function in `VariationsRelationManager.php`, add/edit/delete the desired variants.
* Add/Update/Delete the newly created Enum name inside `config/enums.php`.
* Update '$casts' on the `ProductVariant.php` model

**If the above steps have been implemented, your newly created variant is ready for use throughout the app.**

> [!NOTE]
>
> **The App comes preloaded with some general variants and some tech variants. You should add the variant types that fit the type of store you're building.**

<!-- One Time Passwords -->

> [!Important]
>
> OTP is now available for an extra added layer of security. To enable OTP just go to your desired panels and uncomment  `//FilamentOtpLoginPlugin::make(),`. The available panels are `AdminPanelProvider.php`, `CustomerPanelProvider.php` and `TeamPanelProvider.php`. If you're going to enable OTP is advisable to enable it on all panels but that depends on your app's needs.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## üìÖ Appointment Management

WittyWorkflow includes a comprehensive appointment scheduling system that integrates with email notifications and calendar systems.

### üèóÔ∏è Appointment System Architecture

The appointment system consists of several key components:

- **Models**: `Appointment` and `Service` models manage the data structure
- **Booking Flow**: Users select services, available time slots, and complete bookings
- **Notifications**: Automatic emails for booking confirmation, reminders, and updates

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Appointments

1. **Configure Business Hours**:
   - Navigate to the Business Hours section in the admin panel
   - Set your regular operating hours for each day of the week
   - Configure special hours for holidays or events

2. **Set Up Services**:
   - Create services that can be booked through the Services section
   - Define duration, price, and description for each service
   - Assign services to specific team members if needed

3. **Configure Email Templates**:
   - Customize email templates for appointment confirmations and reminders
   - Set up notification preferences for both staff and customers

### üìã Managing Appointments

Appointments can be managed through the Filament admin panel:

1. **View Appointments**:
   - See all upcoming appointments in a calendar or list view
   - Filter by date, service, or status

2. **Create Appointments**:
   - Add appointments manually for walk-in customers

3. **Update Appointments**:
   - Reschedule appointments as needed
   - Change service or duration
   - Add notes or special requirements

4. **Cancel Appointments**:
   - Cancel with automatic notification to the customer
   - Optionally offer rebooking options

### üîß Customizing the Appointment System

The appointment system can be customized in several ways:

- **Booking Rules**: Modify booking rules in `app/Models/Appointment.php`
- **Email Templates**: Customize email templates in `resources/views/emails/appointments/`
- **Booking Form**: Extend the booking form in `resources/views/livewire/appointment-form.blade.php`

## üß™ Testing

WittyWorkflow comes with a comprehensive test suite covering models, features, and integrations.

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
php artisan test

# Run specific test suite
php artisan test --testsuite=Feature

# Run specific test
php artisan test --filter=HeroTest
```

### üìÅ Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
- **Feature Tests**: Test complete features and user workflows
- **Browser Tests**: Test UI interactions using Laravel Dusk (if installed)

The test files are organized in the following directories:

- `tests/Unit/`: Unit tests for individual classes and methods
- `tests/Feature/`: Feature tests for complete functionality
- `tests/Feature/Models/`: Tests for model functionality

### ‚úçÔ∏è Writing New Tests

When adding new features, create corresponding tests in the appropriate directory:

- Model tests in `tests/Feature/Models/`
- Feature tests in `tests/Feature/`
- Browser tests in `tests/Browser/` (if using Dusk)

Example of a basic model test:

```php
/** @test */
public function it_can_create_a_model()
{
    $model = YourModel::factory()->create();
    $this->assertInstanceOf(YourModel::class, $model);
    $this->assertDatabaseHas('your_models', ['id' => $model->id]);
}
```

## üé® Customization Guide

WittyWorkflow is designed to be highly customizable without modifying core files.

### üé≠ Theme Customization

- **Colors**: Modify the color scheme in `tailwind.config.js`
- **Typography**: Change fonts and text styles in `resources/css/app.css`
- **Layouts**: Customize layouts in `resources/views/layouts/`

### üß© Extending Core Functionality

- **Custom Resources**: Add new Filament resources in `app/Filament/Resources/`
- **Custom Widgets**: Create dashboard widgets in `app/Filament/Widgets/`
- **Custom Fields**: Add custom form fields in `app/Forms/Components/`

### üìö Common Customization Examples

1. **Adding a Blog**:
   - Create a Blog model and migration
   - Add a Filament resource for managing blog posts
   - Create public routes and views for displaying posts

2. **Custom User Roles**:
