## 🚀 About The Project

WittyWorkflow is a TALL stack (Tailwind CSS, Alpine.js, Laravel, Livewire) foundation designed for building niche marketplaces and small business management tools. Whether you're crafting an e-commerce shop, managing appointments, or creating custom workflows, this modular platform—powered by Filament PHP—offers a robust starting point. It's built to be forked, extended, and deployed fast, with features like role-based dashboards, Stripe payments, and customizable UI out of the box.

Originally a demo app, WittyWorkflow has evolved into a versatile base for real-world projects. A prime example? It's being adapted into the Artisanal Food Production Manager—a marketplace example connecting artisanal producers to customers, complete with product listings, orders, and secure payments. Developers can use it as-is for small business needs or tailor it to specialized industries like handmade goods, local services, or boutique retail.
