# Performance Optimizations Implemented

Based on the identified performance bottlenecks, the following optimizations have been implemented:

## 1. Redis Caching

- Updated `.env` file to use Redis for caching:
  ```
  CACHE_DRIVER=redis
  ```
  This provides better performance than file-based caching, especially under high load.

## 2. Production Caching Optimizations

- Created `optimize-production.ps1` script to enable Laravel's production caching optimizations:
  - Config caching (`php artisan config:cache`)
  - Route caching (`php artisan route:cache`)
  - View caching (`php artisan view:cache`)

  Run this script in production to significantly improve application performance.

## 3. Cached CRUD_settings Queries

- Added caching to permission checks in Filament resources:
  - `ProductResource::canCreate()`
  - `ProductResource::canEdit()`
  - `ProductResource::canDelete()`
  - `HeroResource::canEdit()`
  - Bulk action visibility in `ProductResource`

  These queries are now cached for 60 minutes, reducing database hits.

## 4. Fixed N+1 Query Issues

- Added caching to role accessor methods in the User model:
  - `getIsSuperAdminAttribute()`
  - `getIsTeamUserAttribute()`
  - `getIsPanelUserAttribute()`

  Each user's role status is now cached with a unique key based on the user ID.

## 5. Implemented Pagination for HeroResource Table

- Updated `HeroResource` table to use pagination:
  ```php
  ->paginated([10, 25, 50])
  ```
  This ensures the table loads only a limited number of records at a time.

## 6. Added Lazy Loading for Images

- Added lazy loading attributes to images in:
  - `ProductResource` table
  - `HeroResource` table

  This improves page load performance by deferring the loading of off-screen images.

## 7. Optimized Database Queries with Eager Loading

- Added eager loading for the user relationship in `DisplayGuestServices`:
  ```php
  Service::with('user')->simplePaginate(self::SERVICES_PER_PAGE)
  ```
  This prevents potential N+1 query issues when accessing user data.

## Next Steps

1. Monitor application performance after these changes
2. Consider implementing HTTP caching for public pages
3. Consider using a CDN for image delivery
4. Add proper indexes to frequently queried columns
