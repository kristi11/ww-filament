# Security & Performance Guide

This guide covers security features and performance optimization techniques for WittyWorkflow.

## 🔒 Security

WittyWorkflow implements multiple security features to protect your application and data.

### 🔐 Authentication Options

- **Standard email/password authentication**
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**
- **One-Time Password (OTP)**

To enable Two-Factor Authentication:

1. In your panel provider files (e.g., `AdminPanelProvider.php`), ensure the following is configured:

    ```php
    ->enableTwoFactorAuthentication(
        force: false, // Set to true to require 2FA for all users
    )
    ```

2. Users can enable 2FA from their profile settings

For One-Time Password (OTP) setup, see the [Configuration Guide](../configuration/README.md#one-time-passwords-otp).

### 🛡️ Authorization System

- **Role-based access control** via Filament Shield
- **Permission management** through the admin panel
- **Policy-based authorization** for fine-grained control

Shield provides a comprehensive permission system:

1. Navigate to the Roles section in the admin panel
2. Create or edit roles with specific permissions
3. Assign roles to users

### 🔒 Security Best Practices

To maintain a secure application:

- Keep all dependencies updated with `composer update` and `npm update`
- Enable HTTPS in production
- Implement proper CORS policies in `config/cors.php`
- Use environment variables for sensitive information
- Regularly audit user permissions
- Keep backups of your database and files

### 🔏 Data Protection

WittyWorkflow protects data through:

- User data encryption where appropriate
- Password hashing using bcrypt
- CSRF protection for all forms
- XSS protection through proper output escaping

## ⚡ Performance Optimization

### 📦 Caching Strategies

Enable Redis caching for improved performance:

1. Install Redis on your server
2. Add Redis configuration to your `.env` file:

    ```
    CACHE_DRIVER=redis
    REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
    REDIS_PASSWORD=null
    REDIS_PORT=6379
    ```

3. Use model caching for frequently accessed data:

    ```php
    $users = Cache::remember('users', 3600, function () {
        return User::all();
    });
    ```

4. Implement view caching for complex templates:
    ```php
    @cache('key', 3600)
        // Complex view content
    @endcache
    ```

### 🗄️ Database Optimization

Optimize database performance with:

- **Indexes**: Add indexes to frequently queried columns

    ```php
    Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
        $table->index('email');
    });
    ```

- **Eager loading**: Prevent N+1 query issues

    ```php
    $posts = Post::with('comments', 'author')->get();
    ```

- **Query optimization**: Use query builders effectively

    ```php
    $users = User::select('id', 'name', 'email')->where('active', true)->get();
    ```

- **Database table partitioning** for large datasets (consult your database documentation)

### 🚀 Asset Optimization

For production environments:

1. Use production builds:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. Enable HTTP/2 on your web server for parallel asset loading

3. Implement a CDN for static assets:
    - Configure your CDN in `.env`:
        ```
        ASSET_URL=https://your-cdn.com
        ```

4. Optimize images with tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim

### 📊 Monitoring and Profiling

Monitor application performance with:

- **Laravel Telescope** for development debugging:

    ```bash
    composer require laravel/telescope --dev
    php artisan telescope:install
    php artisan migrate
    ```

- **Laravel Horizon** for queue monitoring:

    ```bash
    composer require laravel/horizon
    php artisan horizon:install
    ```

- **Spatie Laravel Health** for system health checks (already included in WittyWorkflow)

- Consider **New Relic** or **Blackfire** for production monitoring

## 🔄 Regular Maintenance

For optimal security and performance:

1. Schedule regular updates:

    ```php
    // In App\Console\Kernel.php
    protected function schedule(Schedule $schedule)
    {
        $schedule->command('cache:clear')->daily();
        $schedule->command('view:clear')->daily();
    }
    ```

2. Monitor logs for suspicious activity

3. Perform regular security audits

4. Test performance under load periodically
