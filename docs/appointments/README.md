# Appointment Management

WittyWorkflow includes a comprehensive appointment scheduling system that integrates with email notifications and calendar systems.

## üèóÔ∏è Appointment System Architecture

The appointment system consists of several key components:

- **Models**: `Appointment` and `Service` models manage the data structure
- **Booking Flow**: Users select services, available time slots, and complete bookings
- **Notifications**: Automatic emails for booking confirmation, reminders, and updates

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Appointments

1. **Configure Business Hours**:
    - Navigate to the Business Hours section in the admin panel
    - Set your regular operating hours for each day of the week
    - Configure special hours for holidays or events

2. **Set Up Services**:
    - Create services that can be booked through the Services section
    - Define duration, price, and description for each service
    - Assign services to specific team members if needed

3. **Configure Email Templates**:
